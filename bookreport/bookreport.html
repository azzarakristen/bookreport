    <p>
In making the book “a world without words,” Jasper Morrison compiled a bunch of seemingly random photographs and put them side by side. This book is small, about the height of my hand, and visually minimalistic. The cover is beige, and the title is small, white, and lowercase. There is little color in this book, because most of the images are in black and white. There is one image on each page, so there are two on each spread. The Gestalt principle of similarity is evident in this compilation for a few reasons. First, every image is lined up with the same top margin. The length and width of the images vary, but they are all positioned the same way relative to the top of the book. This creates a sense of consistency in the design. Second, the two pages on each spread are visually consistent with one another. Even though the contents of each image are different, every pair of images that are put next to each other either have similar visual textures or shapes. For example, one spread contains a picture of a moulded plastic chair designed by Robert Lewis and James Prestini on the left page, and a picture of the trade fair pavilion designed by Luciano Baldessari on the right. These objects are very different, but the shape of the pavilion calls back to the sweeping curves of the plastic chair. Third, there is a small section of this book where the images are in color. This relates to the similarity principle because, when quickly flipping through the edges of the pages, this section stands out from the rest. It lacks similarity, in terms of color. I really appreciate the system Jasper Morrison used in placing the images, and how he kept that top margin the same on every single page. I like the amount of white space left on the pages, and how the captions are small and sans-serif on the bottom of the page. The bottom margin is smaller than the top margin, but since the captions are so small compared to the images it looks balanced. Interestingly, the captions are not centered, but are also not aligned to the very left of the page. They all begin at the same increment over from the left. Overall, I enjoy the design of this book.
